Bridging Worlds with Iranian Ceramic & Tile

Turning Challenges into Global Opportunities
Our brand’s journey began in the heart of adversity. When the Iranian ceramics industry faced severe sanctions, resource shortages, and economic turbulence, we saw these as catalysts for innovation, not limitations. Every decision—from raw material selection to developing export-oriented production lines—was made with a global perspective and a commitment to world-class quality. Through a passionate team of engineers and continuous investment in cutting-edge technology, our products evolved to not only meet but often surpass international standards. From humble beginnings to supplying landmark architectural projects across Iran and more than 13 countries, our tiles symbolize the enduring spirit and ingenuity of Iran—proving that true success is born from overcoming adversity.

A World-Class Product Portfolio
At …, our product categorization is designed for more than convenience—it's about delivering a new, immersive purchasing experience.
Each tile is the result of months of market research, rigorous material testing, and direct collaboration with renowned architects and expert users. Our product pages feature high-resolution images showing every face and texture, real-life installation photography from luxury and modern projects, exhaustive material descriptions, and full technical packaging details.
Every category clearly highlights key features: exceptional scratch and impact resistance, long-lasting color and texture stability even in high-traffic areas, impermeability to moisture, stain resistance, and top safety standards for indoor and outdoor installations.
With innovative designs, a broad spectrum of colors and sizes, and a truly global design language, our portfolio enables clients to realize any vision—minimalist, contemporary, classic, or traditional. Each batch undergoes strict QA and is shipped in robust, export-grade packaging to ensure pristine product quality upon delivery—even through the most demanding supply routes. Environmental responsibility and energy efficiency are woven into every phase of production, making our products both beautiful and sustainable.
